Tool:   xtraverse

/// UNDER CONSTRUCTION ///


To use this tool:

1. make
2. ./xtraverse
   This prints the usage of the tool.

Usage:

./xtraverse [-s start directory] [-f output file]

Traverses the directory structure starting at "start directory." If no
-s switch is given, it defaults at root. It outputs the XML view of the
filesystem starting at "start directory" or root to "output file." If no
-f switch is given, the output is directed to standard output.

Comments:
You can get some performance statistics, if you define a variable
XMLTK_PERFORMANCE as compile flag.
